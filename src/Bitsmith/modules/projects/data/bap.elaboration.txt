	considerations
		system architecture address high-risk use cases?
		system reflect overall enterprise architecture?
		working end-to-end architectural prototype?
		scope sufficiently defined?
			scope change in this phase?
			high-level definition changed in this phase?
				what it will do
				what it won't do
			all high-level features, user-stories/use-cases defined?
		estimated cost, changed in this phase?
		risk list, risk remediation plan
			additional risks identified in this phase
			architectural prototype addresses highest risk element?
			feasability
				technical
					'make sense' from a technical perspective?
					can we build and deploy the project?
				operational
					operational requirements can be met?
					will changes be required?
			construction
				personnel
					current staffing plan for next phase
					projected staffing requirements and resources
				environment
					delivery team have workspace?
					software licenses?
					project environment plan for construction -> production
			security
				risklist
		vision & requirements stabilization
			groomed and prioritized product backlog
			navigation & visual style, coding-standards
			service level agreement
		architectural stability
			architectural diagram with technology choices
			diagrams (as appropriate)
				class, component, activity, state, entity-relationship, pow
			architectural prototype (risk abatement)
		estimate acceptance, risk acceptance, plan for construction
			updated estimates
			uppdate release schedule
			updated risk list
			test strategy, functional, load
			initial deployment plan
			initial deployment diagram
			specific sprint goals defined for next phase (construction)
