	value-proposition:		micro-service architecture risk abatement
							platform vendor independence (aws/azure)
							config management consistency, accuracy, delivery							
	requirements:
							functional
								appSettings, connectionStrings, centrally managed
							non-functional
								high-availability
								implemented as micro-service
							security
								secure transport only
								admin only write
								api, micro-service only read
							business-case
								RemoteConfig-US101
									As a [configAdmin] I want to create a new remoteConfig (from scratch or from template or by prototype)		
										Use Cases
											UC-US101-01: create a template, 
											UC-US101-02: create a config manually
											UC-US101-03: create a config from a template
											UC-US101-04: create a config by prototype
											UC-US101-05: perform diff between template and config
								RemoteConfig-US102
									As a [configAdmin] I want to make changes to an existing remoteConfig
										Use Cases
											UC-US102-01: edit existing config, live and value by value
											UC-US102-02: edit existing config changeset (scheduled effective date)
											UC-US102-03: roll back scheduled changeset

								RemoteConfig-US103
									As a [configAdmin] I want to schedule the release of changes to a remoteConfig
										Use Cases
											UC-US103-01: update the effective date of a changeset
								RemoteConfig-US104
									As a [configAdmin] I want to compare multiple remoteConfigs (document form, comparison form)
										Use Cases
											UC-US104-01: select 2->n remoteConfigs and compare as dataset, or document
								RemoteConfig-US105
									As a [configAdmin] I want to compare delivered remoteConfig with serverside remote config (current and scheduled and proposed)
										Use Cases
											UC-US105-01: perform proxy call against remote-config-server and compare against application-in-memory remote-config
								RemoteConfig-US106
									As a [configConsumer] I want to fetch configuration from a remote source (based upon dateTime, current)
										Use Cases
											UC-US106-01: perform proxy call against remote-config-server, current, or parameterized for given datetime

								RemoteConfig-US107
									As a [developer] I want to easily view current configuration values (actual in memory, and output to administrative config formats)
										Use Cases
											UC-US107-01:
